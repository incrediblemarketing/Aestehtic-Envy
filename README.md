### Sync ACF Fields
This theme comes packaged with several pre-built custom Field Groups via ACF Pro. After activating incredibletheme and Advanced Custom Fields Pro, these fields are automatically imported, **however if you edit any of them without syncing first, it treats your edits as NEW fields resulting in duplication issues**.

To avoid this, **sync the existing field groups before changing any fields**:
1. Go to Custom Fields
2. Click Sync available
3. Check all field groups
4. Select Bulk Actions > Sync
5. Click Apply

At this point you should have `incredibletheme` installed with all custom field groups imported and synced. Moving forward you should be able to edit anything you want without issue.


### Using Gulp
The Gulp tools in this build allow you to use sass, imagemin, js min/concat and js/css linters for errors. CSS media queries are also combinded for shorter code. Follow the steps below to get started!

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
2. cd to your project and run `npm install`.
3. Go to line 13 in gulpfile.js and update to reflect your local setup.
